$.onScreen (jQuery Plugin)
==========================

> _Isn't life a series of images that change as they repeat themselves?_  
Andy Warhol


## Purpose

* Control slides projection (Media + overlays) on the background or on any element of your page.
* Any further call makes a nice transition between the active slide and the new ones.
* Transitions can be controlled by JS scripts or CSS3 animations.

## Extensible with plugins.

The only included plugin is an image stretcher plugin that allow deferred loading of images, 
thus reproducing all the functionality of backstretch.  
Further plugins allready allow to display : transparent slide, video slides (Vimeo, Youtube..)

## Slideshows plugins.

Slideshow is not a native functionality but it's really easy to implement : just call 
`$.onScreen()` several times and here is your slideshow..  
A basic slideshow plugin is offered that just takes a list of media sources and can be 
controlled with the keyboard.
